How Properties Are Set
======================

There are multiple ways to set properties in Franks, depending on your deployment environment. For you as a developer, the distinction between system properties and Frank properties is the most important. System properties are defined outside your Frank while Frank properties are defined within your Frank. There are also properties that are set automatically by the Frank!Framework. Details relevant for system administrators are explained in chapter :ref:`deploying`.
