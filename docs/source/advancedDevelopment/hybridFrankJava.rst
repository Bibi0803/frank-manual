Hybrid Frank and Java Development
---------------------------------

In :ref:`gettingStarted`, you worked with the Frank!Runner to set up your development environment. If you are combining Frank development with custom Java code, you may consider another approach. The Frank!Framework is itself a Java webapplication that handles its dependency management with Maven, see GitHub repository https://github.com/ibissource/iaf. From this repository we build multiple Maven artifacts that can be found on Maven Central. Browse to https://search.maven.org and search for keyword ``ibissource`` to find them.

For more information about using the Frank!Framework within a Java development environment, see file ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` within the GitHub repository https://github.com/ibissource/iaf. This GitHub repository also has a subdirectory "examples" that contains Frank configurations within a Java development environment.
