Sandbox
=======

This section should not be shown. It is a test of the TutorialSteps Python code included in the Git repository of the manual.

In this chapter we learn a simple charm. What if you wanted to be a bird and fly?

We start with the Dutch translation of "I would like to be a bird":

.. literalinclude:: ../../srcSteps/sandbox/v01/charm.txt
   :language: none

But this does not sound nice. We finish it by adding some Latin:

.. include:: snippets/sandbox/v02/addLatin.txt

Now it is complete. Please note that "was" rhymes with "pas".
