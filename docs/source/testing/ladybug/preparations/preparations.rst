Preparations
============

As said in :ref:`introduction`, this subsection walks you through
setting up your environment. You need this environment to follow
the instructions of the proceeding sections. Feel free not
to follow the instructions and just read along. In that case,
you do not need this environment and you can skip this section.

Here are the instructions:

* Install the Frank!framework using the Wearefrank! Quick Docker Installer.
* Download :download:`zip ladybug.zip`.
* Unzip this file. You should get a directory "ladybug" as a brother of "docker4ibis"
* When you work under Windows, you need Postman. Install it from https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/. Note that only one of the proceeding subsections requires you to use Postman. You can do the rest of this tutorial without.
* When you work under Linux, you need curl. If you do not have curl, there is one section you cannot do. The other sections do not require curl.
