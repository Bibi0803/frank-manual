Use Web Interface
=================

As explained in :ref:`introduction`, this tutorial demonstrates Ladybug
by testing a simplified electronic archive. Subsection :ref:`preparations`
explains how the electronic archive is installed. In this section we access
the electronic archive outside the Frank!framework.

The electronic archive, or more precisely its portal (see :ref:`introduction`)
provides a HTTP interface. Windows users can access it using Postman, while Linux users use curl.
This is the only section that requires these tools. If you do not have them, you can
skip this section or install them as explained in :ref:`preparations`.

The instructions are different for Windows and for Linux. Windows users
go to :ref:`useWebInterfaceWindows` while Linux users go to
:ref:`useWebInterfaceLinux`.
