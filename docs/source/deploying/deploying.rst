Deployment
==========

In :ref:`globalIntroduction` it was said that the Frank!Framework is a solution to quickly build enterprise applications, called Franks. A Frank consists of the Frank!Framework that is combined with Frank configurations. Frank configurations configure the Frank!Framework to provide the services you need. They are written as XML documents and property files. The chapters :ref:`gettingStarted` and :ref:`advancedDevelopment` explain how to write Frank configurations. This chapter can be studied independently from :ref:`gettingStarted`. It is not about writing Frank configurations, but focuses on deployment. How can a given Frank configuration be deployed on the IT infrastructure you want?

Here is the table of contents of this chapter:
