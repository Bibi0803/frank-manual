Tomcat4Frank
============

Tomcat4Frank allows you to run a Frank right from the command line. It automates downloading Apache Tomcat, deploying your Frank and booting the Frank!Framework. Your Frank configuration is expected to have directories ``classes``, ``configurations`` and ``tests`` as explained in :ref:`gettingStarted`. You can download Tomcat4Frank from GitHub.
