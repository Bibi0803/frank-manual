Operator manual
===============

This chapter is written for operators of the Frank!Framework. This chapter does not require prior knowledge of the Frank!Framework. In particular, you can read it without first reading chapters :ref:`gettingStarted` or :ref:`testing`.

The Frank!Framework can be used to quickly build enterprise applications. It offers building blocks that can be glued together by writing XML configuration files and property files. These Frank configurations are typically written by Frank develpers, who offer them to you as a site owner. As a site owner, you should monitor whether your site is running properly. If there are troubles, you will be the first to notice and you may have to do something.

This chapter presents the Frank!Console, the graphical user interface that will support you. The Frank!Console offers you a dashboard that shows the status of all Frank configurations. You can use the Frank!Console to track errors. Sometimes, an issue can be fixed by retrying a message for which processing failed earlier. You also use the Frank!Console to load Frank configurations, or new versions of Frank configurations, into the Frank!Framework. With the Frank!Console you can also schedule tasks to be executed periodically. Finally, security is demonstrated. The system administrator can restrict access to the Frank!Console to prevent unauthorized users from modifying your site.
