Background
--------------

 From the Gorilla  team a question came to solve some of the problems they had. Major issues were
 -Syncing with the main Edudex repository had to be done manually
 -Several scripts for these syncs were built and were without maintenance
 -Overview was lost and an incident way of working claimed much organisational resources

Project description
--------------

An Ibis was built to demonstrate how this kind of a problem is solved.
