Introduction
============

Java has a long and rich history of enterprise grade application developement. Apart from Sun/Oracle a lot of Open Source Java libraries have been developed.
Getting all these libraries to work together can be difficult. Proving that
they do so is another challenge, especially when database transactions
or xa transactions are involved.

Adding a GUI to your application for service managers to manage your application
usually isn't you first priority. But it is important for a production
environment. Once you've build your management console you also have to think about
authentication and autorisation (LDAP, DTAP, ..).

Building an enterprise grade Java application has a lot of challenges. The Ibis
Adapter Framework tries to take away a lot of these challenges, helping you to
build a better enterprise grade application, or as we say an Ibis
application, or for short an Ibis.

Ibis-es are written in XML. Please read :ref:`gettingStarted` to learn how to
write an Ibis and to learn what services the IAF provides for it.
