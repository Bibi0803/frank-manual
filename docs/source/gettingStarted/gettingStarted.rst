Getting Started
===============

This chapter introduces you to the basic features of the Frank!Framework. If you are a Frank developer, please study this chapter before investigating more advanced topics. If you are a tester, you can study our product Ladybug without reading this chapter; see :ref:`ladybug`.

This chapter can be studied in two ways. First, it is a tutorial. There are instructions that you can follow to get hands-on experience with the Frank!Framework. You will use the WeAreFrank! Quick Docker Installer, to be found at https://github.com/ibissource/docker4ibis. You can check your work by downloading the solutions. Download links will be provided. Second you can just read the text on your laptop or even your telephone.
