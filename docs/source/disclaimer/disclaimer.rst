Images
------

The Frank!Manual contains many images. Some of them are screen captures of large areas of the Frank!Console. Such large screen captures look best when you view them with Firefox. With other browsers, notably Google Chrome, large screen captures are more difficult to read. This image quality issue is caused by the following. Your webbrowser downloads the Frank!Manual, including its images, from ReadTheDocs. These images typically have to be reduced (less pixels). It appears that Firefox applies a better algorithm for this than Google Chrome. We tried to change the algorithm for image reduction as is explained at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image-rendering. This did not help.

If you have difficulty reading an image, please magnify it. You can also right-click the image and select "Open image in new tab" (or something similar).
