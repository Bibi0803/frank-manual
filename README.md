# IBIS4MANUAL

This project documents the Ibis Adapter Framework for software integration. The IAF itself is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/ibissource/iaf. The audience for this manual about the IAF is developers, testers and system administrators. It first explains what the IAF is and how it can be used. Developers can learn from this manual how to write Ibisses, which are programs written to be deployed on the Ibis Adapter Framework. Testers can learn what features the IAF offers to support testing and debugging. The Ibis Adapter Framework hosts ibisses and adds features for system administration. These features are also explained in this manual.

This project contains restructured text files. These are plain text files with extension .rst. These files should be processed by the Sphinx tool to produce the formatted manual. This is achieved using the website www.readthedocs.io. This GitHub repository has a Git hook pointing that site, triggering an automated build each time a commit is added. The result can be read at http://ibis4manual.readthedocs.io.
