# List of directories that should be zipped for download
# links in the manual. Comments and empty lines are
# ignored.
#
# A relevant line has one or two fields separated by a space.
# If there are two fields, the first field is the input directory
# and the second field is the output directory. These are relative
# paths. Input directories are relative to the frank-manual root
# directory. Output directories are relative to the download zips
# directory configured in generateAll.py. All paths should be
# Linux-style; the path separator is "/". Do not use symbolic links
# or paths with "." or "..".
#
# If there is only one field, the output directory will be the
# last component of the input directory.
